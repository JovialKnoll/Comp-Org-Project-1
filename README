This readme needs more words in it.


overall structure of program:

    generate all of the 'processes' and sort them as necessary

    run all processes according to each of the five management systems
    (not all of the methods should use queues.  it's not always ideal.)

    after all management systems finish, prints out all of the data
    about average times and whatnot.
